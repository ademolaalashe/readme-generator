 ## Description:

 When creating an open source project on GitHub, it's important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include the app's purpose, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. This last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

This command-line application dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. 

  ## Installation:

  Fork the project and clone the repository. Then install all necessary dependencies with:
  ```npm install```

  ## Usage
  To initiate readme generator type in your terminal:
  ``` node index.js```
